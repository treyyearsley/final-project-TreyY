//You and a friend really enjoy looking for shed antlers in the spring.
//You each keep a tally of how many you find each week.
//You are able to shed hunt for ten weeks before it is too hot outside. 
//Please create a set for you and a set for your friends and store how many antlers you each found in the appropriate set.
//Use the quantities as follows. You: 6, 14, 1, 5, 10, 3, 12, 7, 9, 11) Friend: (8, 9, 7, 5, 10, 3, 15, 6, 4, 14).
//Find out by using the intersect function if you and you friend found the same amount in a particular week.
//Use the union function to find all common data between the two sets. There will be no duplicates in the new set.
