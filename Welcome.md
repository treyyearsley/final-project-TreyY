# C# Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to the C# Data Structures Tutorial.  Every C# programmer should strive to understand these Data Structures:

- [Stacks](https://github.com/byui-cse212/s24-final-project-treyyearsley/blob/main/Stacks/Stacks.md)
- [Sets](https://github.com/byui-cse212/s24-final-project-treyyearsley/blob/main/Sets/Sets.md)
- [Trees](https://github.com/byui-cse212/s24-final-project-treyyearsley/blob/main/Trees/Trees.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples.  At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own.  You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
