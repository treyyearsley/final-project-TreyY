# Stacks
## What is a Stack?
A stack is a data structure that is characterized by the way data is stored and accessed. Stacks use a "Last in, First Out" rule which is just as it sounds. The last piece of data to be entered into the stack will be the first to be removed.

## How does a Stack work?


## Stacks in C# and Efficiency of Common Set Operations
| Common Stack Operation | Description                           | C# Code               | Performance/ Big O Notation                                                          |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| add(value)             | Adds "value" to the set               | mySet.add(value)      | O(1) - Performance of hashing the value as long as there is good confilct resolution |
| remove(value)          | Remove "value" from the Set           | mySet.remove(value)   | O(1)- Performance of hashing the value as long as there is good confilct resolution  |
| member(value)          | Determine if "value" is in the Set    | mySet.Contains(value) | O(1)- Performance of hashing the value as long as there is good confilct resolution  |
| size()                 | Return the number of items in the set | mySet.Count           | O(1)- Performance returing the size of the set                                       |
